Polymorhpism
poly	=	many
morphism	forms

Two O's

overriding
	new implementation to something: a method
		toString()
overloading
	new variation
		a  method with 1 arg, 2-args, etc
			constructors



a class can have components

Abstract class

interface

		both: components of a class

Abstract class
	used to create a class with purpose of group similar entities


	Trip
	-cost
	-distance	
	-orgin
	-destination

		BusTrip
			-maxPassengers
		CarTrip
			-washroomBreakStops
		PlaneTrip

	cannot be instantiated
	used as a dedicated SuperClass
	abstract class CAN contain all features of Concrete class
		constructors, instance variables, constants, methods
	NEW FEATURE ALERT
		an abstract class can have an abstract method
			whhhaaaaaat?! What is that?
		abstract method: a method can has no default implemention. it is a method that has no method body

	Shape
		area
		perimeter
			what is the default formula to calculate any shape's 
			area and/or perimeter?




interface another component of a class
	only contains constants and method definitions (abstract methods)
	-list of requirements

	
	Pet
		speak
		eat
	
	DangerousPet
		dangerLevel
		optimalFeedingTime
	
	all entities are public

How do I know what to choose?
	1) Abstract classes contain more features
	2) A class can implement many interfaces
