Concepts

In java 1 class can only inherit from ONE other class

every Java class inherits Object class
	Object class is the Godfather class: base class for everyone


Super class is more general than Sub class
	What does general means?
		It has less stuff in it (instance vars, methods)

* Constructors are not inherited in sub classes
