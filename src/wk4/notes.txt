To-Do-List class
    list of items to complete
        hard-code (known amount)
        dynamic list (???? amount)

    add a task
        a single
        two tasks
        three tasks


overloading: creating a new variation to a method
                ??? bc Java does not support default args for methods


Tasks To Complete
    create a method named: displayTasks
        outputs all the tasks, each task on one line
            can you create multiple, inner methods? Yes
    view
        overloaded
            no-args:    output all tasks. probably in your best interest to call on displayTasks method
            1 int arg: output just that task
            2 int args: output tasks from index X to Y (inclusive)

    delete
        overloaded
            1 int arg: just remove that task. for array, set task as null * do know display tasks where value == null in ANY of the view/displayTasks methods
            2 int args: deleted asks from X to Y

    update:
        2 args: int, String
            update the task at the given index with the specifed String task

WordGuessingGame
    create 3 sets (arrays or arraylist) of words
        Set 1: words 5 letters are less  =>  easy list
        Set 2: words between 5 - 8 letters or less = > medium list
        Set 3: words more than 8 letters => hard list
    max number of guesses (constant values)
        easy:       10
        medium      5
        hard        3
    enum  levels        easy, medium, hard
    instance variable to store
        currentLevel, numberOfUserGuesses, maxNumberOfGuessesGivenLevelChosen
    String wordToGuess      chosen at random given the level chosen. choose a random word from that list

    constructor
        1-arg: level
            set the game up to select a random word, set the number of maxNumberOfGuessesGivenLevelChosen, currentLevel

    play
        displayWord like Jeopardy ( _ in place of letters)
        ask user to guess either word or letter
        if user input is 1 character long

                            hint, you will need to add extra instance variables
                if not
                    then tell user that letter is not found in word
        if user input is more than 1 character long
