Tasks To Complete
    create a method named: displayTasks
        outputs all the tasks, each task on one line
            can you create multiple, inner methods? Yes
    view
        overloaded
            no-args:    output all tasks. probably in your best interest to call on displayTasks method
            1 int arg: output just that task
            2 int args: output tasks from index X to Y (inclusive)

    delete
        overloaded
            1 int arg: just remove that task. for array, set task as null * do know display tasks where value == null in ANY of the view/displayTasks methods
            2 int args: deleted asks from X to Y

    update:
        2 args: int, String
            update the task at the given index with the specifed String task
